# Econ 101
Section 008 Wokia Kumase (HH 162)

## Intro
- Economic questions are from wanting more than we can get
  - Source of problems is *scarcity*
  - Scarcity means making choices based on *incentives*: rewards that encourage an action or a penalty that discourages an action
- Economics deals with allocation of limited resources to deal with unlimited human wants
  - *Microeconomics*: focus on choices of individuals and businesses
    - e.g. **how will a change in the price of beer affect demand?**
  - *Macroeconomics*: focus on the choices and performance of the national economy (aggregate values)
    - e.g. **how will a tax increase affect economic growth?**
- Resources required for the production of goods/services, *Factors of Production (FOP)*, are limited in supply
  - Land/natural resources
  - Labour: physical/intellectual services of people
  - Capital: production plant and equipment used in production
  - Entrepreneurship: Organizer of land, labour and capital
- Return to Factors of Production: Land (rent), labour (wages), capital (interest), entrepreneur (profit)
  - Scarcity of FOP means constrained choices about goods we can produce and consume
  - Agents of observation in an economic system are grouped into two groups: *Household* and *Firms*

```
- HH provides FOP and satidfies their desires through consumption by using the returns from FOP to purchase goods/services from firms
- Firms have demand for FOP which is needed for goods/services production
- Raises three questions: Allocation, distribution, coordination
#### Allocation
- How can we efficiently use the FOP?
- What should be produced?
#### Distribution
- For whom?
- How is it distributed between HHs?
- How are FOP returns distributed to the FOP owners?
#### Coordination
- Self-interest versus social interest
- How can consumption plan of all GG be coordinated to maximize utility of goods available?
- Should production plan of all firms be coordinated to efficiently use FOP?
- Is coordination of production/consumption plan required to make supply meet demand?
#### Solutions
- *Planned* vs *Market* economy
- A choice is a tradeoff
- A rational choice is one that achieves greatest benefit over cost for person making choice
  - Answers first question: what goods and services will be produced and in what quantities?
- The benefit of something is the gain or pleasure that it brings and is determined by preferences
  - Preferences are what a person likes and dislikes and the intensity of those feelings
- The opportunity cost of something is the highest valued alternative that must be given up to get it
  1. The things you cant afford to buy if you purchase something, e.g. a concert ticket
  2. The things you can't do with your time if you go to the concert
- How much - choosing at the margin
  - Choice isn't all or nothing, you must decide how many minutes to allocate to each activity
  - Compare benefit of a little more study time with its cost - make choice at the margin
  - Benefit from pursuing an incremental increase in an activity is its *marginal benefit*
  - the opportunity cost of pursuing an incremental increase in an activity is its *marginal cost*
- Choices respond to incentives
  - A change in marginal cost or a change in marginal benefit changes the incentives that we face and leads us to change our choice
  - The central idea of economics is that we can predict how choices will change by looking at changes in incentives
#### Economist as social scientist
- *Nomative* statements merely reflect people's values and cannot be tested
- *Positive* statements attempt to explain how an economic system works or to predict what will happen and can be statistically evaluated
### Identifying Cause and effect
- Economic models are used to simplify and analyse complex world situations
- *Exogenous variable*: value is taken as a given in model
- *Endogenous variable*: value is determined in model
- Microeconomic models rely on:
  1. Constrained optimization
    - The way we study interaction between scarcity and rational choice
    - Problems consist of objective function (decision to be max/minimized) opposed to a set of constraints (limits)
  2. Equilibrium analysis
    - Equilibrium is a state that will continue as long as exogenous factors remain unchanged
    - Forces of supply and demand interact to determine equilibrium quantity/price in market economy
    - No equilibrium means system experiences excess demand or supply
  3. Comparative statics
    - Used to examine how changes in an exogenous variable will affect the level of an endogenous variable in an economic model

## The Economic Problem
- Define the production possibilities frontier and use it to calculate opportunity cost
- Distinguish between production possibilities and preferences and define efficiency
- Explain how current production choices expand future production possibilities
- Explain how specialization and trade expand production possibilities
- Describe the economic institutions that coordinate decisions
- Why does food cost more than it did a few years ago?
  - Now we use part of corn for ethanol
  - Drought has reduced global grain production
- *production possibilities factor* is used to learn why ethanol production and drought have increased the cost of producing food
- We also use this model to study how we can expand our production possibilities

- PPF is the boundary is the boundary between those combinations of goods and services that can be produced and those that cannot
- To illustrate PPF, focus on two goods at a time and hold quantities of all other goods/services at constant
- Make model where everything remains the same (ceteris paribus) except two things

###Graphing PPF
- Things on edge of graph are most efficient
- Slope of PPF is the opportunity cost

# Operating Systems
## Goals
- Abstract away hardware knowledge so that programs don't need to worry about them
- can evolve by replacing interals while conforming to the interface
- manage resources available on the computer


## Pieces
### Kernel
- runs in main memory
- contains most frequently used functions

### Monitor
- Runs in Kernel mode, allows access to protected memory and can run privileged functions
- Controls sequence of events
- Batch programs together
- program returns control when finished


### Hardware features
- Memory protection (disallowing an area to be altered)
- Timer (prevents a job from taking up all the time)
- privileged instructions (certain intructions can only be run by the monitor)

### Time sharing systems
- Multiple users on terminals, users should see feedback immediately


## Processes
- Program in execution
- instance of program running
- entity that can be assigned to and executed on a processor
- A single unit of activity characterized by
  - a single sequential thread of execution
  - a current state
  - an associated set of system resources
- Contains three components:
  - executable program
  - associated data needed for program
  - execution context of program (everything the OS needs to manage the process)
- Common problems with designing system software:
  - has to juggle multiple programs, threads, interrupts, IO, shared resources
  - improper sync
  - failed mutual exclusion
  - nondeterministic operation
  - deadlocks

## Memory management
- process isolation
- automatic allocation and management
- support swapping program code
- protection and access control
- long term storage
- virtual memory
  - allows programmers to address memory logically without worrying about physical memory
  - virtual address: page number plus offset in page
  - real address: physical address


## Info Protection
- Availability: protects against interruption (e.g. RAID, dual power supply)
- Confidentiality: permissions (e.g. `chmod`)
- data integrity: protect data from unauthorized modification
- authenticity: proper verification of identity of users (e.g. phishing, XSS)


## Scheduling
- Fairness
- Differential responsiveness
  - discriminate among different classes of jobs
  - QoS
- Efficiency: maximize throughput, minimize response time

# Modern Operating Systems
- Microkernel architecture (e.g. QNX)
  - assigns only a few essential functions to the kernel
	  - address spaces
	  - interpricess communication (IPC)
	  - basic scheduling
  - everything else in user space
- Multithreading
  - Process divided into concurrent threads
  - Thread: dispatchable unit of work, can be interrupted
  - Process is a collection of threads
- Symmetric multiprocessing
  - multiple processors
  - share memory and IO
  - can all do the same things
- Distributed
  - illusion of single main memory
- asymmetric multiprocessing
  - moderate success of cell processor
  - Big-Little architectures
- Faults
  - permanent, temporary, transient/intermittent
  - redundancy (spacial, temporal, info)
  - process isolation, concurrency control, VMs, checkpoints/rollback
- Multicore
  -  concurrency: reentrant routines, proper kernel structure management
  -  scheduling: user-level, kernel level
  -  sync: IO management from single or multiple cores
  -  memory management: spacial separation of memory
  -  reliability and fault tolerance: new types of faults

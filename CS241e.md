# 1. Introduction
## Bits
- Have no assigned meaning by themselves

### Conventions
There are infinitely many integers, but only 2<sup>32</sup> can be represented on a 32-bit system, so arithmetic is done on the finite ring of equivalence classes mod 2<sup>32</sup>.

### Numeric Interpretation
- As an unsigned integer, there are 2<sup>32-1</sup> integers in a 32-bit int
- In Two's Complement signed integers, the first bit is the sign bit
  - Addition, multiplication, and subtraction are the same as om  integers
  - Division and magnitude comparison need separate operations for unsigned and Two's Complement numbers

## Our Computer
The computer we're using happens to have state equivalent to {0, 1}<sup>2<sup>26</sup> + 32 * 34</sup>

PC = program counter (the register we're on)

The CPU implements a function `step`:
```
step: state -> state
s_(i+1) = step(s_i)
Def: step*(s) = if (step(s) defined) step*(step(s)) else s

input
  | encode
  v       step*
  s_0 -----------> s_n

Want:
For all i, f(i) = decode(step*(encode(i)))

(program, input)           (program, data)      
       |                         ^
       | encode (compiler)       | decode
       |                         |
       v         step*           |
       s_0 -------------------> s_n
```

### Definitions
A **stored program computer (von Neumann machine)** includes the program as part of its input
- `step` should be general
  - `sem*(program, input) = decode( step*( encode(program, input) ) )`
  - `sem ((lambda (x) e) v)`
    - `[x |-> v] e`
    - `x` gets sustituted with `v` in `e`

**Semantics**: meaning of a program
- **operational semantics**: semantics defined in terms of a function that transforms state
  - an interpreter, basically

### Defining step functions
```scala
def step(state) = {

  // fetch
  instruction = state.memory[state.register[PC]]

  // increment PC
  state2 = state.setRegister(PC, state.register(PC)+4)

  // decode, execute
  instruction.match {
    // ...
  }
}
```

## MIPS
Reference: https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs241/mips/mipsref.pdf
- When a word is stored to memory location 0xffff000c, the least-significant byte (eight bits) of the word are sent to the standard output.
- Loading a word from memory location 0xffff0004 places the next byte from standard input into the least-significant byte of the destination register.

An **opcode** is a short name for a machine language instruction
**Assembly language** is a language for writing machine language programs with opcodes
An **assembler** is a program that translates assembly language to machine language

### Labels
An abstraction of memory addresses

e.g.: absolute value
```assembly
SLT 2, 1, 0
BEQ 2, 0, 1
SUB 1, 0, 1
JR 31
```

Same example, using labels:
```assembly
SLT 2, 1, 0
BEQ 2, 0, label
SUB 1, 0, 1
Define label
JR 31
```

e.g. a procedure
```assembly
... ; main
... ; program
LIS 1
USE label
JALR 1
...

DEFINE label
... ; procedure
...
...
JR
```

To compile out labels, we need two passes:
1. Determine the address of each label
2. Generate code for all the instructions with labels converted to their corresponding addresses

#### Relocation, Linking
An **object file** is a file that contains:
- machine language code
- metadata recording how labels were used before the translation to machine language

**Relocation** is the process of adjusting machine language code using object file metatada so that it can be loaded at a different address by:
- reverse-engineering labels
- reassembling at a new address

**Linking** is the process of combining multiple object files into a machine code program
- To link assembly language files, just concatenate them together
- To link object files:
  - reverse-engineer the labels from the metadata
  - relocation, label resolution across different files
  - concatenate assembly language programs
  - reassemble them to machine language

Typical C build process:
```
C source              Assembly        Object
files              files           files
a.c -----------> a.s -----------> a.o ---+
   Compiler (cc)    Assembler (as)       |
                                         |
b.c -----------> b.s -----------> b.o ---+--> linker (ld) ------> executable machine language program
                                         |
                                         |
c.c -----------> c.s -----------> c.o ---+
```

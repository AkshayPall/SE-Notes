# Introduction
## Bits
- Have no assigned meaning by themselves

### Conventions
There are infinitely many integers, but only 2<sup>32</sup> can be represented on a 32-bit system, so arithmetic is done on the finite ring of equivalence classes mod 2<sup>32</sup>.

### Numeric Interpretation
- As an unsigned integer, there are 2<sup>32-1</sup> integers in a 32-bit int
- In Two's Complement signed integers, the first bit is the sign bit
  - Addition, multiplication, and subtraction are the same as om  integers
  - Division and magnitude comparison need separate operations for unsigned and Two's Complement numbers

## Our Computer
The computer we're using happens to have state equivalent to {0, 1}<sup>2<sup>26</sup> + 32 * 34</sup>

```
PC = program counter (the register we're on)

The CPU implements a function `step`:
```
step: state -> state
s_(i+1) = step(s_i)
Def: step*(s) = if (step(s) defined) step*(step(s)) else s

input
  | encode
  v       step*
  s_0 -----------> s_n

Want:
For all i, f(i) = decode(step*(encode(i)))

(program, input)           (program, data)      
       |                         ^
       | encode (compiler)       | decode
       |                         |
       v         step*           |
       s_0 -------------------> s_n
```

### Definitions
A **stored program computer (von Neumann machine)** includes the program as part of its input
- `step` should be general
  - `sem*(program, input) = decode( step*( encode(program, input) ) )`
  - `sem ((lambda (x) e) v)`
    - `[x |-> v] e`
    - `x` gets sustituted with `v` in `e`

**Semantics**: meaning of a program
- **operational semantics**: semantics defined in terms of a function that transforms state
  - an interpreter, basically

### Defining step functions
```scala
def step(state) = {

  // fetch
  instruction = state.memory[state.register[PC]]

  // increment PC
  state2 = state.setRegister(PC, state.register(PC)+4)

  // decode, execute
  instruction.match {
    // ...
  }
}
```

## MIPS
Reference: https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs241/mips/mipsref.pdf
- When a word is stored to memory location 0xffff000c, the least-significant byte (eight bits) of the word are sent to the standard output.
- Loading a word from memory location 0xffff0004 places the next byte from standard input into the least-significant byte of the destination register.

An **opcode** is a short name for a machine language instruction
**Assembly language** is a language for writing machine language programs with opcodes
An **assembler** is a program that translates assembly language to machine language

# Compiler features
## Labels
An abstraction of memory addresses

e.g.: absolute value
```assembly
SLT 2, 1, 0
BEQ 2, 0, 1
SUB 1, 0, 1
JR 31
```

Same example, using labels:
```assembly
SLT 2, 1, 0
BEQ 2, 0, label
SUB 1, 0, 1
Define label
JR 31
```

e.g. a procedure
```assembly
... ; main
... ; program
LIS 1
USE label
JALR 1
...

DEFINE label
... ; procedure
...
...
JR
```

To compile out labels, we need two passes:
1. Determine the address of each label
2. Generate code for all the instructions with labels converted to their corresponding addresses

### Relocation, Linking
An **object file** is a file that contains:
- machine language code
- metadata recording how labels were used before the translation to machine language

**Relocation** is the process of adjusting machine language code using object file metatada so that it can be loaded at a different address by:
- reverse-engineering labels
- reassembling at a new address

**Linking** is the process of combining multiple object files into a machine code program
- To link assembly language files, just concatenate them together
- To link object files:
  - reverse-engineer the labels from the metadata
  - relocation, label resolution across different files
  - concatenate assembly language programs
  - reassemble them to machine language

Typical C build process:
```
C source              Assembly        Object
files              files           files
a.c -----------> a.s -----------> a.o ---+
   Compiler (cc)    Assembler (as)       |
                                         |
b.c -----------> b.s -----------> b.o ---+--> linker (ld) ------> executable machine language program
                                         |
                                         |
c.c -----------> c.s -----------> c.o ---+
```

## Variables
A **variable** is an abstraction of a storage location (register, *fixed* or *dynamically determined* address in memory) that can hold a value

Read from address ALPHA to $1:
```assembly
LIS 2
WORD ALPHA ; Saves address ALPHA into register 2
LW 1, 0, 2 ; Loads value from memory address ALPHA into register 1
```

### Variable instances
e.g.
```scala
def fact(x: Int): Int = if (x < 2) 1 else x*fact(x-1)
fact(3)
// fact(3) = 3 * fact(2) = 3 * 2 * fact(1) = 3*2*1 = 6
// Three instances of x occur in this execution
```

```
               fact(1)
               +--------+
       fact(2) |        |
       +-------+        +-------+
fact(3)|                        |
-------+                        +--------
                 time -->
```

The **extent** of a variable instance is the time interval in which it can be accessed
e.g.
procedure-level variable: execution of procedure
global variable: entire execution of program
field of object/record: from he time that object is allocated to time it is deallocated/freed (explicitly or automatically with GC)

### The Stack
The extent of local variables begin and end in a **last in, first out** order. A **stack** allows us to create and destroy storage locations this way.

#### Implementation
- Designate a variable (register, usually; R30 in this course) to hold the address at the top of the stack (the **stack pointer**)
- To push to stack: decrement stack pointer by 4
- To pop from stack: increment stack pointer by 4

After entering a procedure with variables a, b, c
```
                  memory
               +-----------+
               |           |
               +-----------+
               |    42     |
               +-----------+
      SP = 100 |     a     | \
               +-----------+ |
           104 |     b     | | stack frame (all local
               +-----------+ | vars from procedure)
           108 |     c     | /
               +-----------+
           112 |   stack   |
               +-----------+
```

e.g. read variable c at offset 8 from SP
```assembly
LWC 1, 8, 30 ; 8, 30 = offset, register
```

**Symbol table**: a map from variables to offsets
**Frame pointer**: a copy of the stack pointer that stays fixed for the duration of a procedure call. It enables us to use the stack for other purposes within the procedure
Convention: use R30 for stack pointer, R29 for frame pointer; bottom of stack is at the end of memory

In this course, all data in memory will be in **chunks**
- areas of consecutive memory locations
- indexed by variables (symbol table)
- base register
- can generate code to read/write variables

## Evaluating expressions
e.g. `a*b + c*d`

### Technique 1 (stack)
```
t1 = a*b
t2 = c*d
t3 = t1+t2
```

```scala
def evaluate(e1, op, e2): Code = {
  evaluate(e1)
  push $3
  evaluate(e2)
  pop $4
  $3 = $4 op $3
}
def evaluateVar(v: Variable): Code = read v (into $3)
```
- general
- inefficient
- difficult to transform further

### Technique 2 (temporary variables)
```
t1 = a*b
t2 = c*d    // generate code to eval e1 op e2, put result in some variable
t3 = t1+t2  // return code, variable
```

```scala
def evaluate(e1, op, e2): (Code, Variable) = {
  (code1, var1) = evaluate(e1)
  (code2, var2) = evaluate(e2)
  v3 = new Variable
  code = block(code1, code2, var3 = var1 op var2)
  return (code, var3)
}
```
- flexible, easy to transform
- machine language operations require registers, so many variables means inefficient use of memory/registers
**Register allocation** isi the process of assigning variables to real registers or memory addresses (abstract)
Minimize the number of registers/memory locations used by **sharing them** amongn non-interfering variables.
```
+------------------+                 +----------------+
|       Code       |                 | IR with real   |
|Intermediate      |---------------->| registers      |
|Representation    |  register       | addresses/     |
|with virtual regs |  allocation     | offsets        |
+------------------+                 +----------------+
```

### Technique 3 (hybrid) (temp vars, but operations on real registers)

```
t1 = a*b  // $4 = a, $3 = b, $3 = $4 * $3, t1 = $3
t2 = c*d
t3 = t1+t2
```
```scala
// generated code leaves result in $3
def evaluate(e1 op e2):Code = {
  val t1 = new Variable
  block(
    evaluate(e1),
    write(e1, 3),
    evaluate(e2),
    read(4, t1),
    $3 = $4 op $3
  )
}
```

### Register allocation
e.g. a+b+c+d+e
A variable is **live at program point p** if the value that it holds at p may be read sometime after p.
The **live range** of a variable is the set of program points where it is live.
- The start of a live range is always just after a write
- The end of a live range is always just after a read
Two variables can share the same register iff their live ranges do not intersect.

#### e.g.
t1 = a * b
- t1 live
t2 = c * d
- t1, t2 live
t3 = t1 * t2
- t3 live
e = t3


#### e.g.
e.g.
t1 = a * b
- t1 live
t2 = c * d
- t1, t2
t3 = t1 + t2
- t3
t4 = e * f
- t3, t4
t5 = t3 - t4
- t3, t5
g = t3 + t5

reg1: t1, t3
reg2: t2, t4, t5

r1 = a * b
r2 = c * d
r1 = r1 + r2
r2 = e * f
r2 = r1 - r2
g = r1 + r2

## Interference graph
- Vertices are variables
- Edge from (v1 - v2) if v1 and v2 conflict (both live at the same program point)
- A **colouring** assigns a colour to each vertex so that every edge connects vertices of distinct colours
  - each colour corresponds to a register, so colouring is a register assignment
  - Finding a minimal colouring of an arbitrary graph is NP-hard.
- A simple greedy algorithm (not optimal):
  - For each vertex v, colour v with the smallest colour not yet used by its neighbours
- Many graphs (SSA form interference graphs) have special structure that enables efficient algorithms


## Control structures
If statements
```scala
if (e1, op, e2, then, else) => {
  withTempVar{t1 =>
    evaluate(e1)
    t1 = $3
    evaluate(e2)
    $4 = t1
    evaluate op
    T
    beq
    define(else)
    E
    define(end)
  }
}
```

Procedures: an abstraction that encapsulates a reusable sequence of code
- calling code and procedure agree on conventions
  - where (memory/registers) to pass arguments and return value
  - which registers procedures may modify (caller-save) or preserve (callee-save)
- calling code **transfers control** to the procedure (modifies PC)
- calling code passes arguments for parameters
- procedure transfers controle back to caller
- returns a value

### e.g.
Caller | Procedure (callee)
-------|-------------------
 | `Define(proc)`
 | `Reg.savedParamPtr = Reg.allocated`
 | `stack.allocate(frame)`
evaluate args in temp vars |
`Stack.allocate(parameters)` | 
copy arguments from temp vars into parameter chunk |
 | `dynamicLink = Reg.fp` (29)
 | `savedPC = Reg.savedPC` (31)
 | `Reg.fp = Reg.allocated` (6)
 | `paramPtr = Reg.savedParamPtr` (get it out of a register)
`LIS(Reg.targetPC)` | `body`
`Use(proc)` | 
`JALR(Reg.targetPC)` | `Reg.savedPC = savedPC`
 | `Reg.fp = dynamicLink`
 | `stack.pop //frame`
 | `stack.pop //parameters`
 | `JR(31)`

A **prologue/epilogue** are the instructions at the beginning or end of a procedure

### Conventions:
Modifies: 31, 6, 5, all others
Preserves: 30 (sp), 29 (fp)
- Caller allocates chunk for arguments
  - puts address in Reg.allocated
- Callee allocates and frees chunk for variables

## Eliminating variable accesses (A5)
- If v is a variable (including a temp var) of the procedure:
  - Access v in the frame chunk (A3)
- Otherwise, v is a parameter:
  - read param pointer from normal chunk into Reg.scratch (4)
  - access v in parameter chunk (with base register Reg.scratch that param ptr was read into)

## Nested Procedures
e.g.
As a loop:
```scala
def m() = {
  var i = 0
  var j = 0
  while (i < 10) {
    i = i + 1
    j = j + i
  }
  i + j
}
```
As a procedure:
```scala
def m() = {
  var i = 0
  var j = 0
  def loop() = {
    if (i < 10) {
      i = i + 1
      j = j + i
      loop()
    }
  }
  loop()
  i + j
}
```

e.g.
```scala
def f() = {
  val x = 2
  val w = 5
  def g() = {
    val y = 3
    val w = 7
    x + y + h()
  }
  def h() = {
    val z = 4
    z + w
  }
  g()
}
```
- A **dynamic link** is a pointer to the frame of the procedure that called the currently executing procedure.
- **static (lexical) scope:** names are resolved in statically enclosing procedures in source code
  - For this course, we will implement static scope
- **dynamic scope:** names resolved in dynamically calling procedures (in the runtime stack of calls)

```
        Frame
      +--------+
   h  |        |      Params
      |   pp   | --> +-------+
      |   dl   |     |       |
      +--------+     |  sl   | ------+
          |          +-------+       |
          v                          |
      +--------+                     |
   g  |        |                     |
      |   pp   | --> +-------+       |
      |   dl   |     |       |       |
      +--------+     |  sl   | ------+
          |          +-------+       |
          v                          |
      +--------+ <-------------------+
   f  |        |
      |   pp   | --> +-------+
      |   dl   |     |       |
      +--------+     |  sl   |
                     +-------+
```
- The **static link** is a pointer to the frame of the statically enclosing procedure (of the currently executing procedure)
- The **nesting depth** of a procedure is the number of outer procedures that it is nested in
  - *TODO:* Add `nestingDepth` to `Procedure`
```
f()={
  g()={}
  h()={
    k()={}
  }
}
```
- To compute the static link at a call site:
  - `depth(sl target) = depth(call target) - 1`
  - `let n = depth(current procedure) - depth(sl target)`
  - `n == depth(current procedure) - depth(sl target)`
  - `n == depth(current procedure) - depth(call target) + 1`
  - If `n == 0`, pass fp as sl.
  - Otherwise, follow sl n times, and pass the result as sl
  - e.g.
    - f calls g: n=0, pass fp as sl of g
    - g calls h: n=1, pass sl of g as sl of h
    - k calls g: n=2, pass sl of sl as the sl of g
    - f calls k: n=-1, not allowed

### Variable Access (eliminateVarAccessesA6)
```
let n = depth(current procedure) - depth(proc declaring var)
```
Follow static link n times, then look for variable

## Midterm
Review: Oct 28 in the tutorial

### Topics
- bits, binary, two's complement
- MIPS, CPU/registers/memory
  - step fetch/increment/execute
- machine language
- operational semantics
- labels/assembly language/symbol table
- relocation/linking
- variables, extent
- stack, frame pointer
- evaluating expressions, if, while
- register allocationlive variables
- procedures: conventions, prologue/epilogue, calling of
- nested procedures, static link

## First-Class Functions
```scala
def procedure(x: Int) = { x + 1 }
var increase: (Int)=>Int = procedure
increase = { x => x+2 }
def twice(fun: (Int)=>Int): (Int)=>Int = {
  x => fun(fun(x))
}
increase = twice(increase)
def increaseBy2(increment: Int): (Int)=>Int {
  def procedure(x: Int) = {x + increment}
  procedure
}
```

### Free variables
A **free variable** in some expression is a variable that is not bound (defined) in that expression.
`x` is free in `x + increment`
`x` is not free in `{x => x + increment}`
`increment` is free in `{x => x + increment}`
`increment` is no longer free in `def increaseBy(increment: Int): (Int)=>Int = {x => x + increment}`

An expression is **closed** if it contains no free variables.
A **closure** is a pair of:
- a function value
- an environment for the free variables in the function body

The closure **closes over** its environment

### Stack vs Heap
```scala
def constructor(a: Int): (Int)=>Int = {
  var b = a*2
  def procedure(c: Int): Int = {
    a+b+c
  }
  procedure //closure creation: will be represented by a `Closure` for us
}
var functionValue: (Int)=>Int = constructor(42)
functionValue(5)
```

`constructor(42)` is a regular call (`Call` in our compiler), specifies a `Procedure`
`functionValue(5)` is a closure call (`CallClosure` in our compiler)

The extent of `a` and `b`:
- begins at the beginning of the constructor
- ends when all copies of the closure have been lost/overwritten, *not* when the constructor finishes
- Therefore we can't put the frame from the constructor on the stack
The **heap** is a data structure that manages memory so that it can be allocated and freed at arbitrary times

### Implementation
After closure creation, store:
- Address of code that implements the closure
  - Label
- environment
  - static link

To call a closure, pass environment as the static link.
Compute the environment/static link in the same way as if we were calling the procedure at the closure creation site

- A closure can access frames of all procedures that it is nested in
- If `p` is nested in `p'` and we ever create a clusure from `p`, then the frame of `p'` must be on the heap (and all of the outer procedures of `p'`)
  - A better compiler does lifetime analysis
    - determine the extent of each variable
    - split the frame between stack and heap

### Objects
```scala
class Counter {
  private var value = 0
  def get() = value
  def incrementBy(amount: Int) = {
    value = value + amount
  }
}

val c = new Counter
c.incrementBy(42)
c.incrementBy(-5)
c.get()

def newCounter: (()=>Int, (Int)=>Unit) = {
  var value = 0
  def get() = value
  def incrementBy(amount: Int) = {
    value = value + amount
  }
  (get, incrementBy)
}
val c2 = newCounter
c2._2(42)
c2._2(-5)
c2._1()
```
- An **object** is a data structure that has:
  - state (data)
  - behaviour (procedures)
- Alternatively, an object is jist:
  - a collection of closures (procedures)
  - a common environment (data)

## Tail calls
This will overflow the stack if there's a large number of recursion and we don't make it a tail call:
```scala
def m() = {
  var i = 0
  var j = 0
  def loop() = {
    if (i < 10000000) {
      i = i + 1
      j = j + i
      loop()
    }
  }
  loop()
  i + j
}
```

A call is a **tail call** if it is the last action before the epilogure
- may be nested inside multiple `if`s
- tail call transformation is *not safe* if calling a nested procedure
```scala
def f() = {
  var v = ???
  def g() = {
    // do something with v
  }
  // epilogue?
  g()
}
```

 | pop (parameters of caller) | 
 | allocate parameters (2) (of callee/target) | 
 | copy parameters (1) to (2) | This is ok because nothing should have written to this memory space yet 
 | | Also, make sure you copy from the bottom up to make sure you don't overwrite anything

What if the caller and/or callee frame is on the heap instead of the stack?
- don't pop from the stack when the frame is actually on the heap
**Tail recursion** is a special case of a tail call that calls the same caller procedure (the procedure calls itself)

# Formal Languages
(CS 360, 365, 462)

- specification (prove/disprove word is in the language)
- recognition (language, word) =&gt; Boolean (not always possible)
  - autogenerate recognizer from specification
- interpretation (language, word) =&gt; meaning (data structure)

**alphabet(&Sigma;)**: finite set of symbols
e.g. {a, b, c, ..., z}, {0, 1, ..., 9}, {0, 1}, {def, var, val, ..., =, (, ), ...}

**word** (over &Sigma;): finite sequence of symbols
e.g. hello, 42, 1010101, def proc(), &epsilon; (sequence of length 0 - empty word)

**language**: set of words (possibly infinite)
e.g.
- all binary strings of 32 bits
- all prime numbers written in decimal
- all correct solutions to A6, A7
- {} != {&epsilon;}

A **language class** is a collection of languages
- finite languages
- regular languages
- context-free languages
- undecidable languages

## Deterministic Finite Automata

start ┌──┐  a   ╔═══╗ │b   ┌──────┐

              accepting/
              final state

```

- If each letter in the word goes to another state, it is in the language
- If the word doesn't end in an accepting state, it is not in the language
- If the word requires a transition that doesn't exist, it is not in the language

&Sigma; = { a,b }
abb &isin; L
a &isin; L
aa &notin; L
&Epsilon; &notin; L

e.g.
&Sigma; = {a, b} where all words with an even number of `a`s are in the language
```
    ┌─────┐  ┌───────────┐

A **DFA** is a 5-tuple (&Sigma;, Q, q<sub>0</sub>, A, &delta;) where:

Symbol | Meaning | Example
-------|---------|--------
&Sigma; | input alphabet | &Sigma; = { a, b }
Q | a *finite* set of states | Q = { odd, even }
q<sub>0</sub> &isin; Q | start state | q<sub>0</sub> = even
&delta; : Q x &times; &rarr; Q | transition function (partial, not defined for all of domain) | &delta;(even, a) = odd
 | | &delta;(even, b) = even
 | | &delta;(odd, a) = even
 | | &delta;(odd, b) = odd

&delta;\* : Q &times; &Epsilon;* &rarr; Q
&delta;\*(q, &epsilon;) = q
&delta;\*(q, first::rest) = &delta;\*(&delta;(q, first), rest)

A word w is **accepted by the DFA** if &delta;\*(q<sub>0</sub>, w) &isin; A

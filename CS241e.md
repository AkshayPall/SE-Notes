# 1. Introduction
## Bits
- Have no assigned meaning by themselves

### Conventions
There are infinitely many integers, but only 2<sup>32</sup> can be represented on a 32-bit system, so arithmetic is done on the finite ring of equivalence classes mod 2<sup>32</sup>.

### Numeric Interpretation
- As an unsigned integer, there are 2<sup>32-1</sup> integers in a 32-bit int
- In Two's Complement signed integers, the first bit is the sign bit
  - Addition, multiplication, and subtraction are the same as om  integers
  - Division and magnitude comparison need separate operations for unsigned and Two's Complement numbers

## Our Computer
The computer we're using happens to have state equivalent to {0, 1}<sup>2<sup>26</sup> + 32 * 34</sup>

The CPU implements a function `step`:
```
step: state -> state
s_(i+1) = step(s_i)
Def: step*(s) = if (step(s) defined) step*(step(s)) else s

input
  | encode
  v       step*
  s_0 -----------> s_n

Want:
For all i, f(i) = decode(step*(encode(i)))

(program, input)           (program, data)      
       |                         ^
       | encode (compiler)       | decode
       |                         |
       v         step*           |
       s_0 -------------------> s_n
```

A *stored program computer (von Neumann machine)* includes the program as part of its input
- `step` should be general
  - `sem*(program, input) = decode( step*( encode(program, input) ) )`
  - `sem ((lambda (x) e) v)`
    - `[x |-> v] e`
    - `x` gets substituted with `v` in `e`
